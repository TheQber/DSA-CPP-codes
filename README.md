# 📘 DSA Solutions – SKCET Placement Portal  

This repository contains my **C++ solutions** to coding problems from the [SKCET Placement Portal](https://placement.skcet.ac.in).  
Each file corresponds to a single question, focusing on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** commonly asked in coding interviews and placement tests.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

- Written in **C++17**  
- Covers **core DSA topics**:  
  - Arrays & Strings  
  - Linked Lists  
  - Stacks & Queues  
  - Trees & Binary Search Trees  
  - Graph Algorithms  
  - Dynamic Programming  
  - Greedy Algorithms  
  - Searching & Sorting  
- Focuses on **time and space efficiency**  
- Directly runnable on coding platforms and compilers  

---

## 🛠️ How to Run  

Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheQber/DSA-CPP-codes.git
cd DSA-CPP-codes
```

Compile and run any file:  
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

## 🎯 Purpose  

This repo serves as:  
- My **personal practice log** for DSA.  
- A **quick reference** for revising interview problems.  
- A **resource** for peers preparing for placements and technical interviews.  

---

## 📌 Notes  

- Solutions are tailored for **placement.skcet.ac.in** test cases.  
- Naming conventions follow problem statements for easy lookup.  
- Some problems may have **multiple approaches** (brute force vs. optimized).

## 📬 Contributions  

If you are from SKCET (or elsewhere) and solving similar problems, feel free to:  
- Suggest optimizations  
- Add alternate approaches  
- Improve documentation
